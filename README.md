# Tech test - 25th July 2025 - Ian Culpan

---

Firstly thanks for allowing time to go through this test
It was a pleasure and not as nerve wracking as I first thought.

With the limited time available and the teething trouble setting up Sail I wanted to complete the functionality.

___

These are my steps to get the example working.
1. Added in code to render products within blade template
2. Created a new route, method and blade template for orders
3. Added CSS for table striping and header text alignment
4. Initialised a git repo to make this a little easier to share.

___

Once again thank you for your time.

I look forward to hearing from you.
